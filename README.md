# Graphing To Be Or Not To Be

Usage: place `tbontb.epub` in the root directory and then run `make` to generate `tbontb.svg`, which you can open in a browser. The SVG includes a relative link to each page from every graph node, as well as inline ending images.

Includes some basic graph analysis in the script `analysis.py`. Running `make` also runs this script to generate `stats.txt` with some basic graph properties.
